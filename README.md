# breast-cancer-classification

This project was inspired by the long list of lovely women in my family who has dealt with Breast Cancer.
This topic is very important and dear to me, and I thought it would be a great way to showcase my skills in 
machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, etc. 
whilst representing sentimental value.
